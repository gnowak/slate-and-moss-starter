## What to look for

Pods = tidy; 20–40W LED bar/panel is enough. Use a smart plug timer → [Kasa Smart Plug Mini by TP-Link](/go/kasa-hs103p2).

## Herbs that fly vs. crawl

Fast: basil, mint, cilantro. Slow: peppers—start early.

## Placement + noise

12–18" clearance; rubber feet tame pump hum. Starter kit: [iDOO 12Pods Indoor Herb Garden Kit](/go/idoo-12-idig301).
