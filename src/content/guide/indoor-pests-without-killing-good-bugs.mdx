## Identify first

Gnats = slow near soil; mites = stippled leaves (check undersides).

## Layered response

1. Water discipline + airflow.
2. Yellow sticky cards near soil → [Sticky Sticks](/go/sticky-sticks).
3. Spot‑treat leaves (mild soap/neem), avoid soaking soil.
4. Quarantine heavy cases a week; repeat.
